In March 2022, Uber announced that they will allow its New York City-based users to hire yellow taxis from its app. While we each all have our own preferences for how we get home on a late night, letâ€™s see if we can see some trends to back up why Uber and taxis have clashed for years. 

Using hired-ride trip data from Uber and NYC Yellow cab from January 2009 through June 2015, and joining with local historical weather data, we will be providing a single Jupyter notebook and SQL queries to answer particular questions by downloading and cleaning data, storing the data in a SQLite database, and providing visualizations.

We are The Columbia Blue.
